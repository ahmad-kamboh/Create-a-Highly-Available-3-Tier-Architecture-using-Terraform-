# Highly Available 3-Tier Architecture on AWS using Terraform

This Terraform project provisions a highly available 3-tier architecture on AWS, consisting of:

- **Presentation Tier:** User interface and communication layer (web servers behind an Application Load Balancer)
- **Application Tier:** Business logic and processing layer (EC2 instances in private subnets)
- **Database Tier:** Data storage and management (MySQL RDS instance in private subnets)

## Overview

This project uses Terraform (v1.2.8) to automate and manage the AWS infrastructure for a scalable and fault-tolerant 3-tier application architecture.

The infrastructure includes:

- VPC with public and private subnets across two availability zones for high availability.
- Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway for internet access.
- Route tables and associations for public and private networking.
- Security groups for each tier with proper ingress and egress rules.
- EC2 instances for presentation and application tiers with Auto Scaling Groups.
- An Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic to presentation tier instances.
- RDS MySQL database instance for the database tier within private subnets.
